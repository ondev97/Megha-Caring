                    <p>I am Dayanthika, a Nurse. I have done my PCR on 18th January and I
                    was tested positive on the next day. By then I was manifesting
                    symptoms such as fever, cold etc. From 19th January night, I have
                    been taking these capsules. After 20th morning meal, I had no
                    symptoms and I was feeling healthy. <br>
                    My husband also started taking the capsules from 19th night. About 11
                    am on 20th morning, PCR tests were done on my husband and two
                    children. We got to know the next day that my husband was tested
                    negative but my children were tested positive. I also gave the
                    capsules to my children from 21st night onwards. They were also
                    manifesting symptoms by then. All symptoms faded away after 2
                    meals.
                    Today is 25th January. Me and my children are healthy and doing very
                    well by now.</p>

                        then I was having the usual symptoms; fever, cold and a cough. In the evening I was admitted 
                        to the National Hospital Hambantota. On 19th January I received this medication through a friend. 
                        From that night on wards I took the medication, three times a day. On 20th evening, I was feeling better. 
                        The next day, there were no symptoms and I was feeling even better. 
                        On 27th I was discharged from the hospital. I am feeling very healthy and definitely back on shape now.

                    <p>Doctor; A Very Good Morning to you! <br><br>
                        I was taken ill on 19th January morning. I was very tired and worn out and uncomfortable 
                        after returning home that day. On 20th,my brother Upali’s wife rang me to check on me. 
                        She told me about Dr. Udara and the medication. She was very confident about him and this medication.
                         She told me that I would be better in 3 days and promised me that she would get the medication early
                          next day and set my mind at ease. Just like a miracle, I was cured. I believe that the whole country 
                          should be made aware of this medication. How many are suffering at this very moment of loss of appetite, 
                          body aches, fever and cold? Imagine everyone being cured in JUST 3 DAYS?! I 
                          wish for long healthy happy lives for all who helped me; Dr. Udara, my brother and sister. 
                          May God bless you and bless with energy and courage to carry on such good work.

                    <p>On 20th January 2021 I experienced an unbearable headache along with body aches and pains. 
                        As I was fully aware of the risk of contracting Corona virus, especially in my neighborhood, 
                        I have started to take the capsules that you have manufactured. After first 3 administrations, 
                        I was feeling better and all my symptoms have subdued. But I have continued taking it for next 2 days, 
                        3 times a day as prescribed <br><br>
                    
                        Corona Virus has reached to the every nook and corner of Kurunegala city. Couple of students of the 
                        school that I work as a teacher, have also tested positive. Their parents were of the nursing staff 
                        of Kurunegala Teaching Hospital and thus children have contracted the virus. I was working under 
                        these highly risky conditions. As I was also suffering from Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, contracting 
                        the virus could have been fatal for me. I am very grateful that my country Sri Lanka hosts wonderful 
                        doctors like you and the medication you gave me, I have no doubt saved my life. I am very pleased to 
                        know that your benevolent services do not stop on our shores but goes all throughout the world.  
                        I am very grateful and appreciative of your services to mankind as a whole. I am truly blessed to have 
                        been informed about this medication. I have never faltered my confidence in it and in your honourable service. 
                        I am very happy that this medication acted very fast, regaining my energy and get me back on form in no time. 
                        It grieves me to see that Diabetic and patients withHigh Blood Pressure are falling victims for Corona virus. 
                        My sincere blessings are with you and may you be able to save millions of people suffering from this horrid virus.
